![](Nostalgia64Preview.png)

Nostalgia 64 is a physics-based spaceship fighting game. Take control of a heavy ship with three thrusters and three weapons, and avoid spinning out of control as you fight enemies in the harsh environment of the void.

- Every part of your ship is a weapon
  - Your three thrusters fire damaging exhaust particles.
  - Your left, right, and special weapons fire standard attacks
  - Your hull deals impact damage on collision
- Every part of your ship is destructible
  - And losing each part makes it unusable for the rest of the fight
